                        <h2>Cookies Policy</h2>
                        <p>Cookies are small pieces of information or text that are issued to your computer when you
                            visit a website and are used to store or track information about your use of the site.</p>
                        <p>Drivefine uses both session‑based and persistent‑based cookies. Session‑based cookies exist
                            only during your web session and expire when you close your internet browser.
                            Persistent‑based cookies are files that stay in one of your browser's subfolders until you
                            delete them manually or your browser deletes them based on the duration period contained
                            within the persistent cookie's file.</p>
                        <p>Drivefine uses cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are strictly necessary to enable
                            core site functionality. We refer to these as “required” cookies. For example, we may use
                            required cookies to authenticate your access to various areas of our Website. Other cookies
                            allow us to enhance your browsing experience, tailor content to your preferences, and make
                            your interactions with our Website more meaningful. We refer to these as “functional”
                            cookies. For example, we may use functional cookies to determine whether you have visited
                            our Website before and inform us about site features in which you have interest, thereby
                            permitting us to better tailor our Website content. Functional cookies also allow us to
                            analyze Website traffic so we can measure and improve performance and speed up your
                            searches.</p>
                        <h2>Web Beacons</h2>
                        <p>Web beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs) are clear electronic
                            images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as the type of
                            browser used to view a website page, when you viewed a particular site linked to the Web
                            beacon, and a description of a site tied to the Web beacon. Certain pages on our Website may
                            contain such Web beacons, which the Company uses to operate and improve the Website..</p>
                        <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
                        <p>An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and
                            communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our Website, we may view the IP
                            address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to
                            determine the general physical location of the device and the geographic regions of our
                            visitors.</p>
